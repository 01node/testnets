# Welcome to the Dymension Hub's first public testnet, Elvis-1!

## Let's take care of business!

_This testnet is non-incentivized. Validators for this testnet have been pre-selected._

## TLDR

Genesis time is: 2022-11-24T14:00:00Z

Block explorer: TBA

Binaries: [v0.1.0-alpha](https://github.com/dymensionxyz/dymension/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha)

Genesis file: TBA

Seeds: TBA

**Minimum hardware requirements:**

-   8-16GB RAM
-   100GB of disk space
-   2 cores

**dymd version**

```sh
name: dymension
server_name: dymd
version: v0.1.0-alpha
commit: f68b1000f040ace7c266b6c4b5e7c4a8b9a31378
```

## Setup

**Prerequisites:** Make sure to have [Golang >=1.18](https://golang.org/).

### Build from source

You need to ensure your gopath configuration is correct. If the following **'make'** step does not work then you might have to add these lines to your .profile or .zshrc in the users home folder:

```sh
nano ~/.profile
```

```
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GO111MODULE=on
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin
```

Source update .profile

```sh
source .profile
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dymensionxyz/dymension.git
cd dymension
git checkout v0.1.0-alpha
make build && make install
```

This will build and install `dymd` binary into `$GOBIN`.

Note: When building from source, it is important to have your `$GOPATH` set correctly. When in doubt, the following should do:

```sh
mkdir ~/go
export GOPATH=~/go
```

Check that you have the right Dymension version installed:

```sh
name: dymension
server_name: dymd
version: v0.1.0-alpha
commit: f68b1000f040ace7c266b6c4b5e7c4a8b9a31378
```

## Setup a Validator Node

Below are the instructions to generate & submit your genesis transaction

### Generate genesis transaction (gentx)

1. Initialize the Dymension directories and create the local genesis file with the correct chain-id:

    ```bash
    dymd init <moniker-name> --chain-id=elvis-1
    ```

2. Create a local key pair:

    ```sh
    > dymd keys add <key-name>
    ```

3. Add your account to your local genesis file with a given amount and the key you just created. Use only `10000000000udym`, other amounts will be ignored.

    ```bash
    dymd add-genesis-account $(dymd keys show <key-name> -a) 10000000000udym
    ```

4. Create the gentx, use only `9000000000udym`:

    ```bash
    dymd gentx <key-name> 9000000000udym --chain-id=elvis-1
    ```

    If all goes well, you will see a message similar to the following:

    ```bash
    Genesis transaction written to "/home/user/.dymension/config/gentx/gentx-******.json"
    ```

### Submit genesis transaction

-   Fork [the testnets repo](https://github.com/dymensionXYZ/testnets/) into your Github account

-   Clone your repo using

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/testnets
    ```

-   Copy the generated gentx json file to `<repo_path>/elvis-1/gentx/`

    ```sh
    cd testnets/Dymension-Hub/elvis-1
    cp ~/.dym/config/gentx/gentx*.json ./gentx/
    ```

-   Commit and push to your repo
-   Create a PR onto https://github.com/dymensionXYZ/testnets
-   Only PRs from selected individuals / groups with a history successfully running nodes will be accepted. This is to ensure the network successfully starts on time.

### Review Genesis File

-   Once all gentx have been collected the Genesis file will be made available:

**Genesis File**

```bash
TBA
```

**Genesis sha256**

```bash
sha256sum ~/.dymension/config/genesis.json
TBA
```

**Validate the Genesis file**

```bash
dymd validate-genesis
```

Add seed nodes in config.toml.

```sh
vi $HOME/.dymension/config/config.toml
```

**Seed nodes**

```bash
# Comma separated list of seed nodes to connect to
TBA
```

**Persistent Peers**

```bash
# Comma separated list of persistent peers to connect to
TBA
```

#### Set validator gas fees

You can set the minimum gas prices for transactions to be accepted into your node's mempool. This sets a lower bound on gas prices, preventing spam. Stakebird can accept gas in _any_ currency. To accept both DYM and ATOM for example, set `minimum-gas-prices` in `app.toml`.

```sh
> vi $HOME/.dymension/config/app.toml
```

```sh
minimum-gas-prices = "0.025udym,0.025uatom"
```

### Genesis time is: 2022-11-24T14:00:00Z

-   Begin the node, once 2/3rd of staked tokens are online after genesis time the blockchain has begun!
    ```sh
    dymd start
    ```

#### Running in production

**Note, we'll be going through some upgrades for this testnet. Consider using [Cosmovisor](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/cosmovisor) to make your life easier.** Setting up Cosmovisor is covered in the [Dymension Documentation](https://docs.dymension.xyz/).

Download Genesis file when the time is right. Put it in your `/home/<user>/.dym` folder.

If you have not installed cosmovisor, create a systemd file for your Dymension service:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/dymd.service
```

Copy and paste the following and update `<YOUR_USERNAME>` and `<CHAIN_ID>`:

```sh
Description=Dymension daemon
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=dymension
ExecStart=/home/<YOUR_USERNAME>/go/bin/dymd start
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the new service:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable dymd
sudo systemctl start dymd
```

Check status:

```sh
dymd status
```

Check logs:

```sh
journalctl -u dymd -f
```
